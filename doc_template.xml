Currently there are some missing features:

- detail textures
- scene lighting data (per vertex lightmaps, texel directional lightmaps)
- moby instances (individual mobys are converted to GLTF)
- Water(?)
- Skybox
- moby animations
- terrain texture blend

Textures are embedded in the GLTF file and converted to be up to GLTF standard.
Textures, that were unable to be linked to GLTFs are normally extracted, however unconverted (normal and template maps)</levelmain_to_gltf>
